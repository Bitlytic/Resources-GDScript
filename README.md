# What is this?

This uses the [Strategy Pattern repo](https://github.com/Bitlytic/Strategy-GDScript) as a base and modifies it to be centered around the use of resources in Godot 4.

### Template Project
This is a top down arena shooter that uses Composition and Resources. It is designed in such a way that you can clone this github repo and use it as a template with a few things ready to go. The assets in this project have also been chosen so that you can use them for quick prototyping and if you decide to go commercial, there is no licensing other than giving credit due.


### GDScript
There is currently no C# version, but it may be ported in the future. Porting GDScript to C# is a little annoying, sorry :P

### Resources Tutorial
This project was made mainly for use in my basic tutorial on Resources on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5vpjCDNa-w)


### Using this Project

Using this project should be as simple as cloning it via git or downloading as a zip file. From there, you can point Godot to the project.godot file, and it _should_ just run.

I do not require credit, you can use this as a template or a learning resource or any way you want to. If you do, you're welcome to share it and tag me on Twitter [@Bitlytic](https://www.twitter.com/bitlytic), or better Twitter [@bitlytic.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/bitlytic.dev), I would love to see what you make!
